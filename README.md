Spirit Virtual Machine
-----
A simple virtual machine that is made for educational stuff!

It will be in three kinds:
- 16SS 16 bit Simple Stack based
- 32AS 32 bit Advanced Stack based
- 32AR 32 bit Advanced Register based

Currently I work on 16SS and after finishing it completely, I'll work on other kinds!
